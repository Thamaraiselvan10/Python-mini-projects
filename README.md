# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects I created while learning Python.
Each project focuses on practicing core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and working with Python’s built-in modules.

The repo includes fun games 🎮, simple utilities 🔧, and interactive simulations ☕ — all written in Python 3.
